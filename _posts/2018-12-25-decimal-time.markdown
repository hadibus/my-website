Europeans often scoff at the fact that we in the United States, unlike the majority of the world, haven't replaced the old imperial length measurement system with the metric system. While we use fractions of inches, inches, feet, yards, and miles, they use millimeters, centimeters, meters, and kilometers. Proponents of the metric system argue that conversion between metric units is easier than using imperial units, and they're right. We know that there are 12 inches in a foot, three feet in a yard, and um... 5,280 feet in a mile. The number of yards in a mile is well known (it's 1760). Now, converting metric units, there are 10 millimeters in a centimeter, 100 centimeters in a meter, and 1000 meters in a kilometer. How many meters are in 25 kilometers? 25,000. How many centimeters? 2,500,000. Since all the conversions are factors of ten, the same number of digits in our counting system (decimal), conversions are easy. The strength of using the metric system does not lie in the fact that the meter is used, but in the fact that it uses factors of ten for conversion.

Using hours, minutes, and seconds (standard time) is similar to using the imperial system. It is terribly confusing. How many days is 400 hours? Just as the meter is used as a standard of measurement with larger and smaller units derived decimally from it, we should do the same with the day and use decimal time. 

Time is ruled by cycles, and those basic cycles have been used to measure time for thousands of years. Some civilizations measure time based on the phases of the moon, while others decided to use the cycle of sun movement which brings the changing seasons. All use the cycle we know as a day. We currently use all of these. The phases of the moon go through a cycle about every 29.5 days. The root of the word "month" is "moon". A seasonal cycle is a year.

From what I have read online, we have 24 hours in a day because of the Egyptians who used a base 12 or duodecimal system of counting.  Using sundials, they split the time the sun shines up into 12 segments. An additional 12 hours were added later to measure time during the night. The Babylonians apparently used a base 60 counting system, and they divided the hour and then the minute. Currently we use a decimal time growing upward from the year with the usage of the word decade. It is not useful to have a decimal system between the length of a day and the length of a year because days and years aren't synchronized cycles, but we should certainly be using a decimal system for time less than a day. Using a decimal clock is exactly what was done for 12 years in post-revolutionary France.

During the use of the French Republican Calendar, A day was split up into 10 hours, an hour was split into 100 minutes, and a minute was split up into 100 seconds. This clock configuration is sometimes called a metric clock, but it's more accurate to call it a decimal clock. Observe how easy it is to read the above clock; you read the hour hand as you'd expect, as a 8. The minute hand is read nearly the same, but the preceding number is the tens of minutes and the ticks are the single minutes. The minute hand is at 16 minutes. the second hand is the same, so it is read as 60 seconds. The time is 8:16 and 60 seconds. Super easy isn't it? Since the time is decimal, that means that a proportion of 0.81660 or 81.66% of the day is passed. How many days is 400 decimal hours? 40 days. One problem with standard time is that one day is two revolutions on a clock face, which is not intuitive. This problem is eliminated with a decimal clock.

One of the problems with moving on to different ways of measuring things is that it is difficult to express accurately which is being used. Take the 24 hour clock as an example, which has been adopted more widely in Europe. People understand it, but in speech, they never use it. It's hard for anyone to know whether someone is talking about the real 8:00, or 8:00 pm. In order to be perfectly clear, they have to default back to using am and pm. I believe this is one reason why decimal time didn't catch on in the rest of Europe and was ultimately abandoned in France. People didn't know which 8:00 was being talked about. Worse was the **redefinition** of already used units. That's no good. In order to use decimal time effectively I propose different, but naturally named units.

Let's say the day was 43.6% over. The day could be split up into **centidays** or hundredths of a day. The time could be called *forty three point six centidays* or simply *forty three six* and written as *43.6 cd* or *43.6ðŸ’¿*. This would be equivalent to 4:36 in decimal time. This has benefits, one being that it is the percentage of the day. Another is that it has a wider number usage than what is used for standard hours, which would reduce confusion.

There is a short time when the colloquial standard time and **centiday time** could be confused. This is the time between midnight and 12.9 cd or 03:05:46 am. one could read this as "twelve nine" and perhaps confuse it with 12:09. But these aren't common hours of the day for one to be doing their daily things, and one could specify by saying "twelve point nine".

As a country or business transitions to centiday time, one of the biggest barriers for people could be changing schedules to adapt to the new units. Let's look at some conversions. One centiday is 14 minutes and 24 seconds, which is about fifteen minutes. Four centidays is 57 minutes and 37 seconds, which is nearly an hour. 34.0 cd is 08:09:36, about an eight hour work day. Interestingly 33.3333 repeating cd is exactly 8 hours, which lets people know that the normal work day is exactly one third of a day. All tasks can now be seen as a proportion of a cycle in which we need to eat, work, play, and sleep. 

The rotation of earth is slowing as time goes by, and thus standardizing the day unit may prove challenging, but that doesn't stop us from using the standardized second as it is now, so there is no increased challenge using centidays. We would just need to add a microday or two in order to correct.

The next time you have a foreign friend tell you that you're using a silly system for measurements, temperature, or liquid volume, inform them about decimal time. Let them know that they are using a silly measurement system for time and they really need to embrace intuitive measurements, push progress, stop the hypocrisy, and let go of their antiquated ways.
