## The Problem

Cursive was taught in school when I was little, and I found it difficult to learn at the time. As I grew older, I started to appreciate it as something more traditional. I remember hearing a story about a waitress at one of my hometown restaurants where she wrote an order in cursive and the cook got upset being unable to read it. When I heard this story I thought it sounded fun to learn. 

One of the behoofs of learning cursive is the ability to write faster, or at least that is what I've been told. In any case, I enjoy it. I have found some bothersome parts of cursive that do slow writing down as I have learned it and those parts are the dotting the 'i's and crossing the 't's.

It's hard to realize when one is writing in block letters, but 'i's and 't's can be very pesky in cursive. In block letters, one can dot or cross right after writing the main vertical part of the letter. In cursive, one must completely finish the word before doing so. From personal experience, it is a bother go back to do this chore. I often would forget to do so. 

## The Solution

The first temptation is to ignore dotting and crossing altogether, but as one might realize, this can cause confusion as an uncrossed 't' can resemble an 'l' and an undotted 'i' around a few 'w's and 'u's can get you lost. 'j' is clearly a 'j' even without the dot. The answer to this problem is to create new strokes to represent these letters. The 't' should be a high arc and the 'i' should be an arc that goes under the line being written on. with no more dotting or crossing, there is no longer a need to lift your pen off the page.

It can take a minute to get used to, but is makes writing much faster. It also makes the writing look more foreign, almost like it's a different language. Some of my favorite words to write this way are 'interesting', 'it', and 'little' since they change so much.

In Russian cursive, a similar thing is done for the character 'Ñ‚', which becomes what an English speaker would call an 'm'.
